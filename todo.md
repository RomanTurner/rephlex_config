- [ ] Make a generator for a layout that includes vite_tags

- [ ] change the layout options to something that can support dynamic variable instead of just a title: tag.

One note on that would be it would just be better to keep it closed as a template and then you can add to the head with the phlex_add_to_head helper.

- [ ] Write a test suite for this.
